## The History of The Beautiful South
  
The Beautiful South was formed in 1988 by Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway, former members of the Housemartins, a popular indie pop band in the UK. They recruited Sean Welch on bass, Dave Stead on drums, and Dave Rotheray on guitar, and signed with Go! Discs, an independent label. Their first album, Welcome to the Beautiful South, was released in 1989 and featured the hit single "Song for Whoever", a sarcastic ballad about writing love songs for money. The album was well received by critics and fans, and reached number two on the UK Albums Chart.
  
The band continued to release successful albums throughout the 1990s, such as Choke (1990), 0898 (1992), Miaow (1994), Blue Is the Colour (1996), and Quench (1998). They also had several top ten singles, such as "A Little Time", "Rotterdam (Or Anywhere)", "Don't Marry Her", and "Perfect 10". The band was known for their witty and often cynical lyrics, their catchy melodies, and their diverse influences, ranging from soul and country to reggae and ska. They also featured different vocalists, such as Briana Corrigan, Jacqui Abbott, and Alison Wheeler, who added contrast and harmony to Heaton and Hemingway's voices.
  
In 2000, the band left Go! Discs and formed their own label, Sony S2. They released three more albums under this label: Painting It Red (2000), Gaze (2003), and Golddiggas, Headnodders & Pholk Songs (2004). The latter was a covers album that included songs by artists such as ELO, S Club 7, Willie Nelson, and The Ramones. However, the band's popularity declined in the 2000s, as they faced competition from newer bands and changing musical tastes. In 2007, they announced that they were disbanding due to "musical similarities". Their final album, Superbi (2006), was followed by a farewell tour and a compilation album called Solid Bronze: Great Hits (2006).
