One effective method is to use Six-Way Paragraphs, a series of books by Walter Pauk that teach you how to read and analyze different types of passages. Six-Way Paragraphs are based on the idea that there are six types of questions that you can ask about any passage: subject matter, main idea, supporting details, conclusions, clarifying devices, and vocabulary in context. By answering these questions, you can improve your understanding of the passage and develop your critical thinking skills.
 
Six-Way Paragraphs are divided into three levels: introductory, intermediate, and advanced. Each level contains 100 passages on various topics, such as history, science, art, sports, and more. Each passage is followed by 12 questions that test your comprehension of the six types of questions. You can check your answers at the end of each book and track your progress.
